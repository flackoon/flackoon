Hi üëã,

I'm flacko and I've been in the blockchain security space since the beginning of 2023. What first started out as a hobby led to me leaving the web2 space after a 7 years long career as a dev in it in September 2023 and dedicating to questioning the security of smart contracts and blockchains of any kind full-time. I've always had an itch about hacking and I've always found it fascinating, and here I am now doing it for a living.

I have a love for code, math, philosophy and finances. I love learning new stuff and actually applying them in practice. My ultimate goal for the future is to eventually do more research and write articles around blockchain security. I'm also interested in operational security as we all know - it's a dangerous web we surf in üëª.

## Skills

| Area | Details |
| ---- | ------- |
| Solidity / EVM | I've now audited a handful of Solidity projects of various types. I don't have a favourite category yet and I'm open to exploring codebases of any type and size. |
| Cosmos SDK / Go | Having audited a few Cosmos SDK based applications now, I feel confident in tackling such projects. Would say I'm just shy of the "intermediate" level here but I discovered I have a knack for Go codebases, so improvements here are imminent and around the corner actually. |

# Stats

In total I've found **15 High** Severity issues (1 of which unique) and **19 Medium** Severity issues (2 of which unique) across **9 different** audits.
