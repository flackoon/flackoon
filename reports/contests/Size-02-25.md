## Underwater borrower can evade liquidations indefinitely by compensating loan

### Summary
Underwater borrower can evade liquidation by front-running calls to liquidate() by calling compensate(). By doing this they can constantly rotate the credit and debt position IDs by simply creating new positions that mirror the old ones, causing underwater positions to accrue even more debt or "buying time" until the position ceases to be liquidateable anymore.

By front-running calls to liquidate() and compensating the entire loan position creating a new debt and credit position, when a liquidator tries to liquidate the now old debt position, the call will revert as the debt position has no future value and is marked as repaid.

### Likelihood Explanation
As can be seen in the project readme, Mainnet and Base networks are supported. Front-running is not viable on Base but it's feasible on Mainnet.

The only relevant validation done when a loan is compensated is that the tenor of the new debt position will be within the configured range in the market's risk config. For the WETH/USDC pool the minimum tenor is 1 hour. If a loan is created with a tenor of 7 days and becomes liquidateable on the 3rd day due to volatile market conditions, the liquidation of the loan could be postponed by the borrower for the next 4 days, except for the last hour.

### Recommendation
Allow compensation of a position by the borrower themselves only if the loan's collateralization ratio improves after execution.
