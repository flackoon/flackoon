## Validators can be grieved to lose their stake if front-ran with the same pubkey

### Summary
As the Omni EVM chain has a public mempool transactions can be monitored and front-ran as it utilizes the go-ethereum execution client which orders them by the gas price paid for them. This allows for a malicious validator to front-run a legit call to `createValidator()` with a huge deposit (`msg.value`) by calling `createValidator()` for the same `pubkey` of an honest validator and a minimal deposit (which is 100 Omni tokens).

The TX will revert on the Omni application side as the `CreateValidator` event that's emitted is processed by the Omni Cosmos SDK application and more specifically the `x/staking` module of the SDK which reverts if the provided public key is already used by another validator. As the comment above the `deliverCreateValidator()` func _evmstaking.go_ reads:

> // NOTE: if we error, the deposit is lost (on EVM). consider recovery methods.

causing the honest user lose their deposit.

As announced midway into the contest:
> 📝 Please note: The validator condition **does not assume that there are no malicious validators**. Any findings where less than 1/3 of malicious validators (by voting power) can impact the network will be considered valid findings.
### Description
When a legit validator $A$'s call to `createValidator()` with `pubkey` $PK$ is front-ran by a malicious validator $B$, a validator will be created in the Omni chain for the validator address-key pair $(B, PK)$. Frontrunning here is possible due to the fact that Omni utilizes the vanilla go-ethereum execution client with a public mempool that prioritizes transactions by the gas price paid for them.

When the legit validator validator $A$'s `createValidator()` call is processed for public key $PK$, the **evmstaking** module `deliverCreateValidator()` method will be called with validator address $A$ and public key $PK$. The method will proceed to create an account for the $A$ address in the Cosmos `x/auth` module Keeper storage. It'll then mint and transfer $STAKE coins to the just-created validator's account and will last call the `x/staking` module Keeper's `CreateValidator` method.

https://cantina.xyz/code/d139882b-2d3a-49ac-9849-9dccef584090/halo/evmstaking/evmstaking.go?text=evmstaking#L149-L195
```go
func (p EventProcessor) deliverCreateValidator(ctx context.Context, ev *bindings.StakingCreateValidator) error {
	pubkey, err := k1util.PubKeyBytesToCosmos(ev.Pubkey)
	if err != nil {
		return errors.Wrap(err, "pubkey to cosmos")
	}

  // Validator address and account address are the same type - ev.Validator address casted to []byte 
	accAddr := sdk.AccAddress(ev.Validator.Bytes())
	valAddr := sdk.ValAddress(ev.Validator.Bytes())

	amountCoin, amountCoins := omniToBondCoin(ev.Deposit)

	if _, err := p.sKeeper.GetValidator(ctx, valAddr); err == nil {
		return errors.New("validator already exists")
	}

	p.createAccIfNone(ctx, accAddr)

	if err := p.bKeeper.MintCoins(ctx, ModuleName, amountCoins); err != nil {
		return errors.Wrap(err, "mint coins")
	}

	if err := p.bKeeper.SendCoinsFromModuleToAccount(ctx, ModuleName, accAddr, amountCoins); err != nil {
		return errors.Wrap(err, "send coins")
	}

  // ...

	msg, err := stypes.NewMsgCreateValidator(
		valAddr.String(),
		pubkey,
		amountCoin,
		stypes.Description{Moniker: ev.Validator.Hex()},
		stypes.NewCommissionRates(math.LegacyZeroDec(), math.LegacyZeroDec(), math.LegacyZeroDec()),
		math.NewInt(1)) // Stub out minimum self delegation for now, just use 1.
	if err != nil {
		return errors.Wrap(err, "create validator message")
	}

→ _, err = skeeper.NewMsgServerImpl(p.sKeeper).CreateValidator(ctx, msg)
	if err != nil {
		return errors.Wrap(err, "create validator")
	}

	return nil
}
```

And as we can see this will execute the following method on the Staking module keeper:

https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.50.10/x/staking/keeper/msg_server.go#L65-L67
```go
// CreateValidator defines a method for creating a new validator
func (k msgServer) CreateValidator(ctx context.Context, msg *types.MsgCreateValidator) (*types.MsgCreateValidatorResponse, error) {
	valAddr, err := k.validatorAddressCodec.StringToBytes(msg.ValidatorAddress)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, sdkerrors.ErrInvalidAddress.Wrapf("invalid validator address: %s", err)
	}

	if err := msg.Validate(k.validatorAddressCodec); err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	minCommRate, err := k.MinCommissionRate(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	if msg.Commission.Rate.LT(minCommRate) {
		return nil, errorsmod.Wrapf(types.ErrCommissionLTMinRate, "cannot set validator commission to less than minimum rate of %s", minCommRate)
	}

	// check to see if the pubkey or sender has been registered before
	if _, err := k.GetValidator(ctx, valAddr); err == nil {
		return nil, types.ErrValidatorOwnerExists
	}

	pk, ok := msg.Pubkey.GetCachedValue().(cryptotypes.PubKey)
	if !ok {
		return nil, errorsmod.Wrapf(sdkerrors.ErrInvalidType, "Expecting cryptotypes.PubKey, got %T", pk)
	}

→ if _, err := k.GetValidatorByConsAddr(ctx, sdk.GetConsAddress(pk)); err == nil {
		return nil, types.ErrValidatorPubKeyExists
	}
```

Which will return a `types.ErrValidatorPubKeyExists` error and will cause the TX to revert as a validator for the consensus address for public key $PK$ already exists.
### Impact
As a result of the above vulnerability the honest validator $A$ will lose their `createValidator()` deposit. Which can be way over the minimum deposit of 100 $OMNI tokens (the native token on the Omni chain).
### Proof of Concept
1. An honest whitelisted validator with EVM address $A$ calls `createValidator()` with public key $PK$ on the Omni EVM chain's pre-deployed **Staking** contract.
2. A malicious whitelist validator with EVM address $B$ sees the validator $A$'s transaction in the Omni EVM mempool and submits a `createValidator()` transaction for the same public key $PK$ but with higher gas to the Omni EVM chain.
3. As the Omni Cosmos application utilizes the go-ethereum execution client to handle EVM-native transactions, it'll prioritize validator $B$'s transaction over validator $A$'s `createValidator()` transaction and thus the `CreateValidator` logs they emit that later are picked by the Omni application will be in the same order.
4. The Omni Cosmos application will process the two events and will call *evmstaking.go*'s `deliverCreateValidator()` method for each.
5. An account will be created for Malicious validator $B$'s address and a new validator with the address $B$ and consensus address derived from the pubkey $PK$ will be created. The two are associated together in the function call to Cosmos' `x/staking` module's Keeper's `CreateValidator()` method.
6. Then the `CreateValidator` log emitted for validator $A$'s call to `createValidator()` is processed. *evmstaking.go*'s `deliverCreateValidator()` is called and it again calls the Cosmos `x/staking` module's Keeper's `CreateValidator()` method.
7. This time an account for the EVM address of validator $A$ is created, but the call to `x/staking` Keeper `CreateValidator()` will fail as the public key $PK$ is already associated to another EVM address - the malicious validator $B$'s address.
### Recommendation
Make validators provide some sort of a proof in the **Staking** pre-deploy contract's `createValidator()` function that they control the private key from which the `pubkey` they are submitting was derived. A signed message would be the simplest.

## Validators will lose all their extra stake delegation if they create a validator and self-delegate to it in the same block

### Summary
If a validator creates a validator by calling `createValidator()` on the Omni EVM **Staking** pre-deploy contract and then call `delegate()` to self within the same block, the deposit provided with the call to `delegate()` will be lost as the `Delegate()` event emitted by the function will be processed by the Omni Cosmos application after the `CreateValidator()` event emitted by the `createValidator()` call.

The events that these two functions emit are used as proxies to calls to the Cosmos `x/staking` module's `Delegate()` function and `CreateValidator()` functions respectively. The problem, however, is that before storing these events as messages to be executed in the next proposed consensus block, they are ordered in an descending order based on their concatenated topics and as a result `Delegate()` events will be processed before `CreateValidator()` events. This is problematic since the *evmstaking*.go module `deliverDelegate()` method reverts when a delegation to a non-existing validator is attempted and thus causing the validator to lose their delegate deposit. Even the module `deliverDelegate()` method itself warns of that:

https://cantina.xyz/code/d139882b-2d3a-49ac-9849-9dccef584090/halo/evmstaking/evmstaking.go?text=evmstaking#L202-L203
> // NOTE: if we error, the deposit is lost (on EVM). consider recovery methods.
### Description
The problem stems from the fact that the events emitted in the Omni EVM chain are sorted before being attached to a `MsgExecutionPayload` message thats included in a consensus chain at block height $H$ proposal and later executed on the Omni EVM chain at block height $H+1$.

https://cantina.xyz/code/d139882b-2d3a-49ac-9849-9dccef584090/octane/evmengine/keeper/abci.go?text=abci#L28-L160
```go
// PrepareProposal returns a proposal for the next block.
// Note returning an error results in a panic cometbft and CONSENSUS_FAILURE log.
func (k *Keeper) PrepareProposal(ctx sdk.Context, req *abci.RequestPrepareProposal) (
	*abci.ResponsePrepareProposal, error,
) {
  // ... code skipped for brevity
  
	// Create execution payload message
	payloadData, err := json.Marshal(payloadResp.ExecutionPayload)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, errors.Wrap(err, "encode")
	}

  // ...
  
	// Next, collect all prev payload evm event logs.
→ evmEvents, err := k.evmEvents(ctx, payloadResp.ExecutionPayload.ParentHash)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, errors.Wrap(err, "prepare evm event logs")
	}

	// Then construct the execution payload message.
	payloadMsg := &types.MsgExecutionPayload{
		Authority:         authtypes.NewModuleAddress(types.ModuleName).String(),
		ExecutionPayload:  payloadData,
		PrevPayloadEvents: evmEvents,
	}

	// Combine all the votes messages and the payload message into a single transaction.
	b := k.txConfig.NewTxBuilder()
	if err := b.SetMsgs(append(voteMsgs, payloadMsg)...); err != nil {
		return nil, errors.Wrap(err, "set tx builder msgs")
	}

	// Note this transaction is not signed. We need to ensure bypass verification somehow.
	tx, err := k.txConfig.TxEncoder()(b.GetTx())
	if err != nil {
		return nil, errors.Wrap(err, "encode tx builder")
	}

  // ...
  
	return &abci.ResponsePrepareProposal{Txs: [][]byte{tx}}, nil
}
```

The way the events are sorted is the root cause of the issue, as they are sorted in a descending order by:
1. `Address` of the contract which emitted the event.
2. The concatenated bytes of the topics of the log of the event.
3. The `Data` of the log.

https://cantina.xyz/code/d139882b-2d3a-49ac-9849-9dccef584090/octane/evmengine/keeper/evmmsgs.go?text=evmmsgs#L16-L62
```go
// evmEvents returns all EVM log events from the provided block hash.
func (k *Keeper) evmEvents(ctx context.Context, blockHash common.Hash) ([]types.EVMEvent, error) {
	var events []types.EVMEvent

  // ... fetch the events from the Staking, PortalRegistry and Slashing pre-deploy contracts and append each of them to the `events` slice

	// .. verify all events

	// Sort by Address > Topics > Data
	// This avoids dependency on runtime ordering.
	sort.Slice(events, func(i, j int) bool {
		if cmp := bytes.Compare(events[i].Address, events[j].Address); cmp != 0 {
			return cmp < 0
		}

		// TODO: replace this with sort.CompareFunc in next network upgrade which is more performant but has slightly different results
		topicI := slices.Concat(events[i].Topics...)
		topicJ := slices.Concat(events[j].Topics...)
		if cmp := bytes.Compare(topicI, topicJ); cmp != 0 {
			return cmp < 0
		}

		return bytes.Compare(events[i].Data, events[j].Data) < 0
	})

	return events, nil
}
```

As shown in the PoC, if a validator creates a validator and self-delegates within the same block, we'll have a slice of 2 logs to sort and as we sort them, the `Address` of both logs will be equal, so we'll sort solely by the concatenated bytes of the topics of the log of the event, causing the `Delegate` event log to come first in the sorted slice and the `CreateDelegator` event log after it. As a result, they'll be processed by the application in this exact order which will cause the `Delegate` call to fail as the delegator is not created:

Now let's take a look at what happens when a `Delegate` event is processed by the Omni Cosmos application. The processing happens in the *halo/evmstaking/evmstaking.go* file:

https://cantina.xyz/code/d139882b-2d3a-49ac-9849-9dccef584090/halo/evmstaking/evmstaking.go?text=evmstaking#L203-L213
```go
// deliverDelegate processes a Delegate event, and delegates to an existing validator.
// - Mint the corresponding amount of $STAKE coins.
// - Send the minted coins to the delegator's account.
// - Delegate the minted coins to the validator.
//
// NOTE: if we error, the deposit is lost (on EVM). consider recovery methods.
func (p EventProcessor) deliverDelegate(ctx context.Context, ev *bindings.StakingDelegate) error {
	if ev.Delegator != ev.Validator {
		return errors.New("only self delegation")
	}

	delAddr := sdk.AccAddress(ev.Delegator.Bytes())
	valAddr := sdk.ValAddress(ev.Validator.Bytes())

→ if _, err := p.sKeeper.GetValidator(ctx, valAddr); err != nil {
		return errors.New("validator does not exist", "validator", valAddr.String())
	}

  // ...
}
```

The method simply errors out if a validator does not exist for the provided `ev.Validator` address.
### Impact
A non-suspecting honest validator will lose the deposit they provided to a self `delegate()` call on the Staking pre-deploy contract when they self-delegate in the same block in which they created a validator via a call to `createValidator()`. A depositor might decide to scale-in by employing the two functions for a variety of reasons, which opens them up for losing the amount they provide to each `delegate()` call in the same block they called `createValidator()`.
### Proof of Concept
Here's a proof how a slice of two event logs: `CreateValidator` and `Delegate` would be sorted by the current `evmEvents()` method. We can ignore the event log's `Address` as both events are emitted by the Staking.sol pre-deployed contract, so `Address` will be the same for the two and the method will proceed to sort the two logs by their concatenated `Topics` instead:

```go

	}
	topicDelegate := slices.Concat(topicsDelegate...)

	events := [][]byte{topicCreateValidator, topicDelegate}

	sort.Slice(events, func(i, j int) bool {
		cmp := bytes.Compare(events[i], events[j])
		return cmp < 0
	})

	fmt.Println("Delagate() topic:          ", topicDelegate)
	fmt.Println("Ordered events at index 0: ", events[0])
	fmt.Println("CreateValidator() topic:   ", topicCreateValidator)
	fmt.Println("Ordered events at index 1: ", events[1])
}

// Output:
//
// Delagate() topic:           [81 11 17 187 63 60 121 155 17 48 124 1 171 125 176 211 53 104 62 245 178 218 152 247 105 125 ... lower bits omitted]
// Ordered events at index 0:  [81 11 17 187 63 60 121 155 17 48 124 1 171 125 176 211 53 104 62 245 178 218 152 247 105 125 ... lower bits omitted]
// CreateValidator() topic:    [199 171 239 123 115 240 73 218 106 155 194 52 155 165 6 106 57 227 22 234 188 159 103 27 111 ... lower bits omitted]
// Ordered events at index 1:  [199 171 239 123 115 240 73 218 106 155 194 52 155 165 6 106 57 227 22 234 188 159 103 27 111 ... lower bits omitted]
```

### Recommendation
Since the ordering of these 2 events (out of all events that the Omni application is monitoring across pre-deployed contracts) is very sensitive and important, it'd probably be best to sort collected event logs by their `Index` - the log of the index in the block.

## Malicious users on Omni can prevent users from bridging back to mainnet temporarily

### Summary
Adversaries can employ a malicious contract to force the `withdraw()` function in the OmniBridgeNative contract to revert by consuming too much gas for example and thus to fail to update  (increase) `l1BridgeBalance`. The `xcall` via which `withdraw()` was executed will not be retried as the current protocol version doesn't support retrying of failed `XMsg`s. This way they'll effectively burn the \$OMNI tokens on L1 and prevent honest users from bridging back \$OMNI to L1 temporarily even though the OmniBridgeL1 contract holds enough funds to satisfy their bridge request.
### Description
Users can bridge \$OMNI from L1 to the Omni EVM by calling `bridge()` on the OmniBridgeL1 contract. The bridge function itself calls `xcall()` on the OmniPortal on Ethereum mainnet scheduling a cross-chain `withdraw()` message to be executed through `xsubmit()` in the OmniPortal on the OmniBridgeNative contract on the Omni EVM.

When the OmniPortal on L1 schedules the `withdraw()` call in the meta TX data it encodes the current \$OMNI token balance of the OmniBridgeL1 contract + the amount that the user just bridged.

https://cantina.xyz/code/d139882b-2d3a-49ac-9849-9dccef584090/contracts/core/src/token/OmniBridgeL1.sol?text=omnibridge#L81-L87
```solidity
    function _bridge(address payor, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        require(amount > 0, "OmniBridge: amount must be > 0");
        require(to != address(0), "OmniBridge: no bridge to zero");

        uint64 omniChainId = omni.omniChainId();
        bytes memory xcalldata =
→           abi.encodeCall(OmniBridgeNative.withdraw, (payor, to, amount, token.balanceOf(address(this)) + amount));

        require(
            msg.value >= omni.feeFor(omniChainId, xcalldata, XCALL_WITHDRAW_GAS_LIMIT), "OmniBridge: insufficient fee"
        );
        require(token.transferFrom(payor, address(this), amount), "OmniBridge: transfer failed");

→       omni.xcall{ value: msg.value }(
            omniChainId, ConfLevel.Finalized, Predeploys.OmniBridgeNative, xcalldata, XCALL_WITHDRAW_GAS_LIMIT
        );
```

This balance is later used by the `withdraw()` function in the OmniBridgeNative contract to cache it so that when users bridge \$OMNI from the Omni EVM to mainnet, they cannot bridge more \$OMNI than the bridge on L1 holds, ensuring all future Omni → L1 bridge transactions can be satisfied. 
https://cantina.xyz/code/d139882b-2d3a-49ac-9849-9dccef584090/contracts/core/src/token/OmniBridgeNative.sol?text=omnibridge#L95-L105
```solidity
    function withdraw(address payor, address to, uint256 amount, uint256 l1Balance)
        external
        whenNotPaused(ACTION_WITHDRAW)
    {
        XTypes.MsgContext memory xmsg = omni.xmsg();

        require(msg.sender == address(omni), "OmniBridge: not xcall"); // this protects against reentrancy
        require(xmsg.sender == l1Bridge, "OmniBridge: not bridge");
        require(xmsg.sourceChainId == l1ChainId, "OmniBridge: not L1");

→       l1BridgeBalance = l1Balance;
```

https://cantina.xyz/code/d139882b-2d3a-49ac-9849-9dccef584090/contracts/core/src/token/OmniBridgeNative.sol?text=omnibridge#L124-L127
```solidity
    function _bridge(address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        require(to != address(0), "OmniBridge: no bridge to zero");
        require(amount > 0, "OmniBridge: amount must be > 0");
        require(amount <= l1BridgeBalance, "OmniBridge: no liquidity");
```

Due to the L1 → Omni EVM bridge happening via `withdraw()` cross-chain message executed through `_call()` in the OmniPortal contract malicious contracts can bridge funds passing a receiver `to` that's a malicious contract that causes the entire `withdraw()` call to fail silently (by consuming all the gas provided to the `_call()` call when the message is executed in the OmniPortal), preventing Omni EVM users from being able to bridge back \$OMNI to L1 as `l1BridgeBalance` was not updated to reflect the new available \$OMNI tokens that were deposited to the OmniBridgeL1 contract on mainnet.
### Impact
Users can be prevented from bridging temporarily after malicious contracts that bridge $OMNI tokens from L1 → Omni EVM to an address that causes the `withdraw()` call to fail, leaving the OmniBridgeNative contract with a stale (and less than actual) `l1BridgeBalance` and users will not be able to bridge tokens until someone bridges from L1 → Omni, leaving them temporarily DOSed.
As of now, there's no retry mechanism for cross-chain messages and given that the entire `withdraw()` message will be caused to fail, malicious users will loose their bridged funds on both L1 and Omni. However, the protocol states in the scope of the audit that a retry mechanism is going to be implemented in the short to mid term:

> - Retry Mechanism
>    - A “retry mechanism” is a way to retry a cross-chain message if it fails.
>    - An in-protocol retry mechanism for failed cross-chain messages is out of scope for V1.
>    - This can be built out-of-protocol in the short term. But likely will be added to the protocol medium-term.

Which means that this attack vector is only going to become cost-free for adversaries to exploit, leading to an easier temporary DOS on the bridging.
### Proof of Concept
1. Malicious user $U$ calls `bridge()` on the OmniBridgeL1 contract, passing the address of contract $C$ as the receiver of the $OMNI tokens on the Omni EVM.
2. An `XMsg` event is emitted to be later picked up and execute a `withdraw()` call with `XCALL_WITHDRAW_GAS_LIMIT` gas limit via the OmniPortal contract on the Omni EVM by the relayer.
3. The relayer relays the bridge transaction to the Omni EVM, executing the `withdraw()` call via `_call()` in the OmniPortal contract providing it with 80 000 gas only.
4. `withdraw()` is called by the OmniPortal and itself executes a low-level `to.call{ value: amount}("")` to transfer the \$OMNI tokens to the malicious contract $C$.
5. The malicious contract $C$ defines a malicious `receive()` function that causes the `withdraw()` function to run out of gas, failing to update `l1BridgeBalance`.
6. Users with \$OMNI tokens on Omni now cannot bridge tokens when `l1BridgeBalance` has once reached zero even though there are \$OMNI tokens in the OmniBridgeL1 contract.

Here's a simplified PoC demonstrating how the malicious contract $C$ can cause the `withdraw()` function to revert via return-bomb attack.

            abi.encodeWithSelector(bridge.withdraw.selector, address(maliciousContract), 1e18)
        );

        // The Bridge contract state was NOT updated due to withdraw() failing altogether
        assertEq(bridge.lastTransferred(), 0);
        assertEq(address(maliciousContract).balance, 0);
    }
}
```

If we run the test with `forge test --match-test test_withdraw_revert` we get the following output:
```sh
Ran 1 test for test/ReturnBombExample.sol:POC
[PASS] test_withdraw_revert() (gas: 369622)
Suite result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 6.62ms (2.24ms CPU time)

Ran 1 test suite in 161.43ms (6.62ms CPU time): 1 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (1 total tests)
```

### Recommendation
Just use `excessivelySafeCall()` instead of a low-level `call()` in the OmniBridgeNative `withdraw()` function to ensure users can force it to fail and thus leaving the contract with a stale value for `l1BridgeBalance`.

## Malicious actors can spam delegation or unjail calls resulting in a chain halt during events processing in `PrepareProposal`

### Summary
Whitelisted malicious validators with a big enough reserve of \$OMNI tokens can spam `delegate()` calls on the Staking pre-deploy contract or `unjail()` events on the Slashing pre-deploy contract on Omni EVM causing the unbounded loop in `evmEvents()` *evmengine* Keeper method to cause the chain to halt due to running out of resources while preparing a proposal.
### Description
The Cosmos SDK documentation warns against loops in unmetered code in its [security handbook](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/building-apps/security-part-1#poorly-chosen-looprecursion-exit-condition):

> **Poorly Chosen Loop/Recursion Exit Condition**
>
> This is a consideration that seems trivial but comes up much more frequently than one might expect. If a loop in unmetered code is never exited or a recursion base case is never hit, it might lead to an expensive chain halt.

The Staking pre-deploy contract imposes a minimum \$OMNI token deposit of `1 ether` equal to 1 \$OMNI when calling `delegate()` but that's too low and allows malicious validators to cause the chain to halt due to the unbounded loops in events collection when a proposal is prepared. Also regular malicious users can also spam the even cheaper `unjail()` calls in the Slashing pre-deploy contract that require just a fee of `0.1 ether` which is equal to 0.1 \$OMNI even if they are not validators, broadening the attack surface for this vector.

This way validators will fail to prepare proposals as every node's `PrepareProposal()` method calls the Octane's *evmengine* module `evmEvents` methods. This collects all monitored events emitted by the following pre-deploy contracts:
- **PortalRegistry**: emits `PortalRegistered` event in a permissioned method; not of interest
- **Staking**: emits `CreateValidator` and `Delegate` events; both are permissionless; `Delegate` is of interest as is cheap to spam
- **Slashing**: emits `Unjail` event which is of interest as is even cheaper to spam and does **NOT** even require the caller to be a validator.
- **Upgrade**: emits `PlanUpgrade` and `CancelUpgrade` events; both are permissioned and not of interest

        require(!isAllowlistEnabled || isAllowedValidator[validator], "Staking: not allowed val");
→       require(msg.value >= MinDelegation, "Staking: insufficient deposit");
```

```solidity
contract Slashing {
    // ...
    
    uint256 public constant Fee = 0.1 ether;

    // ...
    
    function unjail() external payable {
→       _burnFee();
        emit Unjail(msg.sender);
    }

    function _burnFee() internal {
→       require(msg.value >= Fee, "Slashing: insufficient fee");
        payable(BurnAddr).transfer(msg.value);
    }
```
### Impact
Validator nodes will fail to generate proposals leading to a chain halt.
### Proof of Concept
1. Multiple malicious users simultaneously start spamming an overwhelming amount of `unjail()` calls  to the Slashing pre-deployed contracts on the Omni EVM in a single block.
2. Validator $A$ is the next proposer for a consensus chain block at round 0. They execute `PrepareProposal()` but the method fails due to needing to collect, process and verify the overwhelming amount of spammed events.
3. Validator $A$ fails to propose a block on time and the next consensus round 1 begins.
4. Validator $B$ is the next proposer for consensus block now at round 1. They also call `PrepareProposal()` but stumble upon the same problem while collecting, processing and verifying the events emitted by the pre-deployed contracts.
5. Validator $B$ also fails to propose a block on time and next consensus round 2 begins.
6. The process goes on indefinitely, resulting in a chain halt as none of the validators are able to prepare a proposal. 
### Recommendation
Allow only up to a certain number calls of `unjail()` or `delegate()` per block. No reasonable validator would have a reason to call them more than even 1 time per block, especially the `unjail()` function and perhaps require that `msg.sender` is a validator in one of the recent validator sets.
